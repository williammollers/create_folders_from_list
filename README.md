# create_folders_from_list

Took the spreadsheet list of members names and converted into a dataframe. 

Cleaned the dataframe (removed unncessary columns, ensured all lower case, replace blank space with _ & made a new column combining first and last names). 

Then converted the full_names column into a list. 

Lastly took that list as a basis to iterate over to create folders in my directory.
